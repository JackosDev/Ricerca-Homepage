Customization
-------------
Open `ricerca.config.js`. Edit everythings that's inside.  
You can add search providers _ad infinitum_. Just follow the examples.
```javascript
ricercaProvidersList = [
// Command, Page name,      Form action,                            Input name
    "!d",   "DuckDuckGo",   "https://www.duckduckgo.com",           "q",
    "!g",   "Google",       "https://www.google.com/search",        "q",
    "!w",   "Wikipedia",    "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php",  "search",
    "!y",   "YouTube",      "https://www.youtube.com/results",      "search_query"
];

ricercaDefaultProvider = "Google";
```

To add the corresponding icon, add it to the `images/icons` folder, with the filename being the same as `Provider Name` and having `.ICO` as format.
